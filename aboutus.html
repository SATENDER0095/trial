  <p class="aboutus"><em><span class="pro">Dumisters</span></em> is used for disposal of <strong>Electronic-waste material</strong>. </p>
  <p class="aboutus">Electronic waste or e-waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices. Used electronics which are destined for refurbishment, reuse, resale, salvage recycling through material recovery, or disposal are also considered
    e-waste. Informal processing of e-waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution.</p>

  <h2 >Informal e-waste recycling sites</h2>
  <p class="aboutus">Guiyu is likely one of the oldest and largest informal e-waste recycling sites in the world; however, there are many sites worldwide, including India, Ghana (Agbogbloshie), Nigeria, and the Philippines. Most research involving
    informal e-waste
    recycling has been done in Guiyu, but there are a handful of studies that describe exposure levels in e-waste workers, the community, and the environment. For example, locals and migrant workers in Delhi, a northern union territory
    of India, scavenge discarded computer equipment and extract base metals using toxic, unsafe methods. Bangalore, located in southern India, is often referred as the "Silicon Valley of India" and has a growing informal e-waste recycling
    sector. A studies found that e-waste workers in the slum community had higher levels of V, Cr, Mn, Mo, Sn, Tl, and Pb than workers at an e-waste recycling facility. </p>
